# Foster Lister
## About Project
The purpose of this site is to connect potential adopters and fosters with animals in need. 
<br>
An example "About Us" found on our site to give a better idea:

>We are a nonprofit organization that helps local shelters connect with potential adopters and fosters.
Our shelters attempt to find forever homes or foster homes for homeless animals, reunite lost pets with their families, and give medical care to animals in need. 
Volunteer opportunities are posted on our site from our partner organizations that are in need of volunteers. 
Our mission is work hard to find animals loving forever homes.
